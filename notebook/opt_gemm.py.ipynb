    "(TL;DR) TVM provides abstract interfaces which allows users to depict an algorithm and the\n",
    "algorithm's implementing organization (the so-called schedule) separately. Typically, writing\n",
    "algorithm in high-performance schedule breaks the algorithm's readability and modularity. Also,\n",
    "trying various seemingly promising schedules is time-consuming. With the help of TVM, we can\n",
    "try these schedules efficiently to enhance the performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will demonstrate how to use TVM to optimize square matrix multiplication\n",
    "and achieve 200 times faster than baseline by simply adding 18 extra lines of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two important optimizations on intense computation applications executed on CPU:\n",
    "    1. Increase the cache hit rate of memory access. Both complex numerical computation and hot-spot\n",
    "       memory access can be accelerated from high cache hit rate. This requires us to transform the\n",
    "       origin memory access pattern to the pattern fits the cache policy.\n",
    "    2. SIMD (Single instruction multi-data), or we call it vector processing unit. Every time, a\n",
    "       small batch of data, rather than a single grid, will be processed. This requires us to\n",
    "       transform the data access pattern in the loop body in uniform pattern so that the LLVM\n",
    "       backend can lower it to SIMD.\n",
    "\n",
    "Actually, all the methodologies used in this tutorial is a subset of tricks mentioned in this\n",
    "`repo <https://github.com/flame/how-to-optimize-gemm>`_. Some of them have been applied by TVM\n",
    "abstraction automatically, but some of them cannot be simply applied due to TVM constraints.\n",

    "All the experiment results mentioned below, are executed on 2015's 15' MacBook equipped with\n",
